I'm pleased to announce NW v0.77.0 with Chromium 114 stable upgrade. The ARM64 architecture is supported on macOS starting from this release.

In NW v0.77, Chromium 114 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **CSS headline balancing, CHIPS, the scrollend event, popover** and more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-114-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 114 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=114).

I've made the 0.77 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 114. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
