I'm pleased to announce NW v0.69.0 with Chromium 106 stable upgrade. It ships Node.js v18.9.1 as well. It also fixed regressions introduced in 0.68.

In NW v0.69, Chromium 106 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **New CSS Features, WebCodecs and WebXR Improvements** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/09/chrome-106-beta-new-css-features.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 106 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=106).

I've made the 0.69 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 106. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
