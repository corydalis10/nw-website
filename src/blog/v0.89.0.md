I'm pleased to announce NW v0.89.0 with Chromium 126 stable upgrade.

In this release, a bug was fixed to support Node.js options in `node-main`. You can now put multiple Node.js command line arguments before the script filename in the manifest field.

In NW v0.89, Chromium 126 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Cross-document view transitions for same-origin navigations, Gamepad API trigger-rumble extension** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-126-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 126 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=126).

I've made the 0.89 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 126. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
