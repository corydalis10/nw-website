I'm pleased to announce NW.js v0.63.0 with Chromium 100.

Chromium 100 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Multi-Screen Window Placement, Media Source Extensions in Workers, Capability Delegation** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/03/chrome-100-beta-reduced-user-agent.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 100 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=100).

I've made the 0.63 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 100. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
