NW.js 0.61.0 is here with the Chromium 98 stable upgrade. It also fixes a crash bug loading websites.

Chromium 98 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **COLRv1 Color Gradient Vector Fonts, structuredClone() Method on Windows and Workers, AudioContext.outputLatency** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/01/chrome-98-beta-color-gradient-vector.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 98 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=98).

I've made the 0.61 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 98. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
