I'm pleased to announce NW v0.74.0 with Chromium 111 stable upgrade and Node.js v19.7.0

In NW v0.74, Chromium 111 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **New CSS color types and spaces, Media Session API: Presenting slides actions, Resizable ArrayBuffer and growable SharedArrayBuffer** and more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-111-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 111 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=111).

I've made the 0.74 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 111. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
