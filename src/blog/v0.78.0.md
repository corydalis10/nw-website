I'm pleased to announce NW v0.78.0 with Chromium 115 stable upgrade. Node.js was updated to v20.2.0 in this version.

In NW v0.78, Chromium 115 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Multiple keywords for the CSS display property, WGSLLanguageFeatures for WebGPU, HTTPS upgrades** and more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-115-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 115 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=115).

I've made the 0.78 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 115. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
