NW.js 0.62.1 is here with Node.js v17.7.1 and Chromium update.

Chromium 99 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **CSS Cascade Layers, New Canvas 2D Features, New showPicker() Method on HTMLInputElement Objects** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/02/chrome-99-css-cascade-layers-new-picker.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 99 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=99).

I've made the 0.62 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 99. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
