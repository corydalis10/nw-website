I'm pleased to announce NW v0.73.0 with Chromium 110 stable upgrade and Node.js v19.5.0

In NW v0.73, Chromium 110 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **IFrame credentialless, CSS pseudo-class :picture-in-picture, CSS Initial Letters** and more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-110-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 110 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=110).

I've made the 0.73 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 110. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
