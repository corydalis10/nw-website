I'm pleased to announce NW v0.86.0 with Chromium 123 stable upgrade.

In NW v0.86, Chromium 123 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **new CSS features, WebAuthn credential creation in a cross-origin iframe, Import attributes with syntax** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-123-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 123 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=123).

I've made the 0.86 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 123. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
