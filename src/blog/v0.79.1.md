NW v0.79.1 is released with Node.js v20.5.1 and some bug fixes.

In NW v0.79, Chromium 116 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **CSS motion path, Back/forward cache NotRestoredReason API** and more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-116-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 116 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=116).

I've made the 0.79 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 116. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
