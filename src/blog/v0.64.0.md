I'm pleased to announce NW v0.64.0 with Chromium 101 stable upgrade.

In NW v0.64, Chromium 101 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **MediaCapabilities API for WebRTC, AudioContext.outputLatency** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/03/chrome-101-federated-credential.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 101 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=101).

I've made the 0.64 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 101. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
