I'm pleased to announce NW v0.85.0 with Chromium 122 stable upgrade.

In NW v0.85, Chromium 122 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Async Clipboard API: Read unsanitized HTML, Storage Buckets API, WebGL drawingBufferStorage** and much more. Please check [upstream release notes](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/chrome-122-beta/) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 122 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=122).

I've made the 0.85 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 122. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on the current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
