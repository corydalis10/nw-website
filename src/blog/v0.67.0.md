I'm pleased to announce NW v0.67.0 with Chromium 104 stable upgrade.

In NW v0.67, Chromium 104 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Region Capture, Media Queries Level 4 Syntax and Evaluation** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/06/chrome-104-beta-new-media-query-syntax.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 104 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=104).

I've made the 0.67 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 104. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
