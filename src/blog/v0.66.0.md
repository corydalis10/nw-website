I'm pleased to announce NW v0.66.0 with Chromium 103 stable upgrade and Node.js v18.4.0.

In NW v0.66, Chromium 103 contains usual under-the-hood performance and stability tweaks, but there are also some cool new features to explore. It supports **Local Font Access, AbortSignal.timeout() Static Method** and more. Please check [Chromium blog](https://blog.chromium.org/2022/05/chrome-103-beta-early-navigation-hints.html) for details. For a complete list of all features (including experimental features) in this release, see the [Chrome 103 milestone hotlist](https://www.chromestatus.com/features#milestone=103).

I've made the 0.66 branch ready soon after Chromium beta bumps to 103. Thanks to the testers for their valuable feedback and bug reports. I've been working on 2 branches simultaneously: a released branch on current Chromium stable and a beta branch on Chromium beta.

Best regards,  
Roger Wang
